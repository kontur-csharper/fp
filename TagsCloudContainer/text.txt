Ethiopian refugees who fled fighting in Tigray province play volleyball at the Um Raquba camp in Sudan's eastern Gedaref province, on November 21, 2020. - Ethiopia's northern Tigray region has been rocked by bloody fighting since November 4, when Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced the launch of military operations there. Neighbouring Sudan, itself suffering from a severe economic crisis, was caught off-guard when the conflict broke out earlier this month. It now hosts some 36,000 Ethiopians, with many in transit camps near the border, according to Sudan's refugee commission.
